# 🌍 Air Quality Index Dashboard using Power BI 📊
## 📌 Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard that visualizes Air Quality Index (AQI) trends across Indian cities using historical air quality data. 
The dashboard provides insights into pollution levels, key pollutants, city-wise AQI distribution, and geospatial mapping, enabling users to analyze environmental conditions effectively.

## 🚀 Features
### Page 1: AQI Trends & City-Wise Comparison
✔ AQI Trend Over the Years – A line chart illustrating AQI variations from 2015 to 2020.

✔ City-Wise AQI Distribution – A bar chart ranking cities by AQI levels.

✔ Interactive City Filter – Allows users to focus on specific city data.

### Page 2: Pollutant Analysis & Geographic Mapping
✔ Pollutant Concentrations – Displays average levels of CO, NO, PM2.5, and SO2.

✔ Top 5 & Least 5 Polluted Cities – Highlights cities with the highest and lowest pollution.

✔ Geospatial AQI Mapping – A Power BI Bing Map visualization for AQI & PM2.5 levels.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
🔹 Power BI – For data visualization and interactive dashboards

🔹 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated fields and measures

🔹 Microsoft Bing Maps – Used for geospatial analysis

🔹 Excel/CSV – Source dataset containing AQI and pollutants

## 📖 How to Use the Dashboard
### Follow these steps to explore the AQI Dashboard in Power BI:

1️⃣ Download and Install Power BI Desktop from Microsoft Power BI.

2️⃣ Load the Dataset (city_day.csv) into Power BI.

3️⃣ Open the Power BI Dashboard.

4️⃣ Interact with the Visuals – Use filters, hover over data points, and analyze pollution trends.

5️⃣ Customize the Report – Modify visuals, add new measures, or integrate live data.

## 📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard
✔ Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna have the highest AQI values, indicating poor air quality.

✔ Ernakulam, Shillong, and Aizawl are among the least polluted cities.

✔ The AQI has shown a declining trend from 2015 to 2020, suggesting improved air quality.

✔ PM2.5 and NO levels are significantly higher in urban regions with industrial activities.

✔ Geospatial analysis reveals pollution hotspots across India, particularly in metropolitan areas.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
🔹 Real-Time AQI Data – Connect with live air quality APIs for real-time updates.

🔹 Predictive Analysis – Implement machine learning to forecast future AQI trends.

🔹 Expanded Coverage – Include additional cities and more detailed pollutant data.

🔹 Power Automate Integration – Automate report updates for continuous insights.

## Conclusion
The Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of air pollution levels across various Indian cities using Power BI. 
By leveraging interactive visualizations, it highlights key pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2, CO, and SO2, identifies the most and least polluted cities, and offers insights into AQI trends.
The geospatial mapping further enhances data interpretation, enabling informed decision-making for pollution control. 
This project serves as a valuable tool for environmental monitoring, with potential for future enhancements like real-time data integration and predictive analytics to further improve air quality assessments.
